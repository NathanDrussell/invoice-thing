# Invoice Thing

## What is this thing?

Invoice thing is invoice management web application I started designing after Theo (@t3dotgg) mentioned how poor QuickBooks experience was.

I intended to make this real application, however I realized that as this wasn't a problem space I understood well and that I would be ill equipped to run.

Thus I have decided to Open source this project as It was a fun little experiment and allowed for many integrations.

Integrations:

- Clerk.com for auth
- AWS for file storage, (I tried UploadThing but it didn't fit my use case)
- PlanetScale for the database, however this is up to the person who deploys
- ShadCDN for setting up base components
- SendGrid for sending emails
- Puppeteer and generating PDFs

Upcoming Integration:
- Stripe to handle payments
